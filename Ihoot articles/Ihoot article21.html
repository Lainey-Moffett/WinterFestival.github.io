<h3>Fall is Coming</h3>
<br>
Every year the leaves turn to vibrant yellows and golds and oranges and gently twirl to the ground. A feeling of joy and cheer starts to fill the crisp, cool air. This season is like a time of renewal, a time of releasing the old and waiting to bring in the new during Spring. It brings delight for holidays that are just around the corner and activities filled with fun.

<h3>Holidays in Fall</h3>
<br>
Halloween is a holiday that came from the Celtic festival of Samhain. People would dress in stunning costumes and light bright bonfires, in hopes of scaring off unwelcome ghosts. Pope Gregory chose November 1 to be a day dedicated to all saints in the 8th century. This later turned into All Hallows Eve and is now known as Halloween. People today celebrate by wearing costumes, just like the Celtics, and going door to door trick-or-treating. Kids love this holiday because they collect lots of candy and treats as they venture through the neighborhood. 

Haunted houses are also another big factor involved in Halloween. Scary rooms are decorated throughout the houses in hopes of frightening those who walk through. Screams of horror echo through these houses, a delight to the owner of the entertainment.

Jack-o-lanterns are carved at this time. Families love to gather together and sculpt out scary-looking eyes, noses, and mouths to scare their guests. The creepy faces flicker from the candle lit inside, giving an ominous feeling to those who watch.

Thanksgiving is another celebrated holiday in fall and is unique to the United States. Plymouth settlers and Native Americans came together in 1621 for the first Thanksgiving feast. People celebrated this holiday for years after, but it wasn’t until 1863 that President Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a national holiday. 

During this holiday, families come together to dive into a delicious feast. Mashed potatoes, sweet potato casserole, green bean casserole, stuffing, cornbread, either ham or turkey, plus a number of other Thanksgiving-unique dishes are traditional at this meal. The magnificent scents of the food preparation fill the homes, making the day even more special and memorable.

Many people decorate their homes with fall decors such as scarecrows, pumpkins, and fall leaves. Pumpkin patches are another tradition of fun where families choose their own special pumpkin, each one unique, to brighten up their homes. 

Another Thanksgiving tradition is watching the Macy’s Day Parade. This family fun event takes place in New York City but can be viewed on T.V. from home. Floats, huge balloons, marching bands, dancers, and other entertainment walk through New York and perform in front of the Macy’s department store. And of course, the one amazing surprise at the end captivates everyone watching: Santa and Mrs. Claus come through on Santa’s sleigh amidst many squeals of delight from young children as the excitement for Christmas fills the air.

Natalie McLaren celebrates Halloween by “…Purchasing candy for the trick or treaters and greeting them with some sweet treats!! We also decorate our house with spooky-themed blow-ups, just to add a bit of fun when a trick or treater comes to knock on our door!!” and Thanksgiving is “…Very family-based for us. Sometimes we invite family to spend Thanksgiving with us, mainly my grandparents. We do a lot of the traditional Thanksgiving food, including Stuffing, Turkey, Green-bean Casserole, and other traditional dishes. We typically make a turkey out of a cinnamon roll and eat it for breakfast, and then pumpkin pie and some eggnog is common for us.” She goes on to say that “Fall IS my favorite season! …I love the colors!! They are different in all parts of the world, and the way that nature changes during fall leaves me in awe. Seeing all the vibrant hues of warm tones reminds me how beautiful our planet is!…. ALSO- the temperatures are SO BEAUTIFUL in the fall!!”
