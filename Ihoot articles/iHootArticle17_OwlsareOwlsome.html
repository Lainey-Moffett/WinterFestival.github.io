The owl is our school mascot as you might know already. Wisley is a very cute little purple owl. Owls resemble wisdom, which is part of our school motto. Although owls are rather cute and cuddly, they can be super fierce!
<br>
<br>
The owl is a really cool <a id="key" href="key1.txt" download><mark>mascot</mark></a>  because it symbolizes wisdom, truth, and shapeshifting. All these symbols are very different things, so let’s break it down.
<br>
<br>
 

<h3>What the Owl Stands For</h3>
The quality of wisdom is otherwise known as being wise. When you are wise you choose to make the right decisions. Do an exercise of your wisdom, and the next time you do something, think, “Is this a wise choice?”. Wisdom is as simple as just being smart. Essentially, when you’re wise you’re being smart, especially if it’s making a choice or even something else in your life.
<br>
<br>
 

The quality of truth is being honest. When you’re honest you can live a great life! You won’t get in trouble for lying, and your life won’t be built on lies! If you get a bad grade on a test and your parents ask how you did, don’t say you got a 100, unless you actually did. Be honest with them, and you’re teachers if they ask. Being truthful makes for a great you!
<br>
<br>
 

Finally, the other quality is that the owl symbolizes shapeshifting. This means that you can be something else and take on the form of another. It’s cool that our mascot represents this because it’s nice to think that the owl is shapeshifting and is a part of every one of us! It’s like it’s becoming us and showing who we are. We are all unique! Don’t try to shapeshift into others, be yourself, and be proud to be an Owl!
