From tutus to pointe shoes to a little girl’s dream, ballet has been appreciated for decades. People would spend their evenings watching ballets and enjoying the theater. But it leads one to wonder, do they know the plots? Do they know how odd ballets can be? After reading this article, you most definitely will!

<br>
Giselle– Let’s begin with a common ballet, one my studio is currently rehearsing for. Giselle is the story of a peasant girl who falls in love with a boy from her village named Albrecht. He proposes to her and she says yes. However, Hilarion is in love with Giselle and becomes jealous of Albrecht. He discovers Albrecht is lying and is a prince engaged to the princess. When Bathilde, Albrecht’s princess, comes to visit the village, Hilarion tells Giselle she cannot marry the man she loves because he is already betrothed to Bathilde. She goes mad, and dies at the end of the first act. The second act begins with Myrtha, Queen of the Willis, or women who have died betrayed by their lover. Hilarion comes to grieve at Giselle’s grave, where the willis arise and dance him to his death. Albrecht comes to visit next, but Giselle cannot help it, she saves him and protects him until sunrise when the willis must go back to their graves. Albrecht mourns Giselle after she returns to the ground, but his life is saved.

The Nutcracker– Continuing with the classics, we have the story of the Nutcracker. Clara and her family host a large Christmas party and invite all their friends. Uncle Drosselmeyer comes to visit and brings with him his magical gifts. Clara is gifted a Nutcracker doll, and loves him at first sight. She dances with the other party guests until it is time for them to go. In the middle of the night, she sneaks back to the living room, grabs the Nutcracker, and falls asleep on the couch. She awakes surrounded by giant rats and their king attacking her. A life size Nutcracker then steps out with his toy soldier army and defeats the rat king. Clara is so grateful, and goes with him to the land of sweets. During this time, they pass through the snow storm, or snow dance that is so widely recognized. In the land of sweets she meets the Sugar Plum fairy and watches all the candies dance. There’s spanish chocolate, arabian coffee, marzipan, chinese tea, and many more. Before her departure, the Sugar Plum and her prince dance. The Nutcracker takes Clara back to her home, where she awakes to see it was all a dream.
