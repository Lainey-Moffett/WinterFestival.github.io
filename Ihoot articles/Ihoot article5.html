The pandemic brought many things to a screeching halt back in 2020. This year, however, little bits of normalcy has come back, letting us be the people we once were, even for a moment. One of those things is the ACL Music Festival.
<br>
 <br>

      <h3> What Is The ACL Music Festival?</h3>

       <br>
    

      Most people associate the word ACL with a ligament in the knee, but this ACL isn’t about that. Located in the beautiful city of Austin, the Austin City Limits is carried out over a 2-weekend span. The performers range from talented local musicians to well-known stars such as Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus, and others. Of course, the ACL didn’t happen last year due to COVID-19 restrictions but in 2021, it is back in all of its glory. 
<br>
 
<br>
       <h3>When Is The ACL Festival?</h3>
<br>
      

      The ACL happens every year in early October, specifically the first 2 weekends of the month. This year, the first weekend was from October 1st to October 3rd and then the 2nd weekend was from October 8th to October 10th. However, despite taking place at the beginning of the very spooky and frightful month that is October, it has more of a summer concert’s vibe.

 <br>
<br>
       <h3>How Many People Perform At The ACL Each Year?</h3>

 <br>

      The ACL is not just a small, simple music festival. Hundreds of artists perform at the ACL. Some are known more in the local scene, and some are more popular on the national level. The ACL has 8 stages where each of the singers performs and takes the entire crowd away with their rhythm.

 <br>
 <br>

      <h3>iUP Students Love It!</h3>

 
<br>
      The majority of iUP students surveyed had no idea what the ACL was, but everyone that has heard of it loved it, whether they have been in-person or not. Here are their thoughts:

 <br>
<br>
“I think I would like it, even though I’ve never gone, because ACL has great music,” -Autumn Friesenhahn
<br>
 <br>

“I went in 2019 and it was super fun” -Emily DeMotte
<br>
 <br>
 <br>

Regardless of anyone’s previous knowledge of the ACL Festival, everyone should go out and experience it for themselves. It will be an absolute blast that leaves smiles on tons of faces.</p>
